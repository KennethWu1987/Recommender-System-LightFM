# Recommender-System-LightFM
scalable Recommeder System for e-commerece using LightFM package in python.

while researching about Recommender Systems, I came across many relevant great projects, However one thing missing was the lack of a clear metric to evaluate the performance of the model. I believe that if you cannot evaluate the performance of your model by providing clear metrics, it might be hard to convince your readers that the model (Recommender System) is working well enough. LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback, including efficient implementation of BPR and WARP ranking losses. Itâ€™s easy to use, fast (via multithreaded model estimation), and produces high quality results.
